# Portfolio Optimization (Monte Carlo + SLSQP)

A Python-based portfolio optimizer that models the efficient frontier using Monte Carlo simulations and optimizes portfolios using SLSQP.

## 📊 Features
- Simulated over 15,000 portfolios to estimate expected returns and risks
- Constructed the efficient frontier from asset return distributions
- Optimized portfolio weights using **SLSQP** to maximize the Sharpe ratio
- Enforced constraints on capital allocation and diversification

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy.optimize
